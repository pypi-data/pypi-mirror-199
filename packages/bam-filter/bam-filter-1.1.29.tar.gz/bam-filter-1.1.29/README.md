# Installation

We recommend having [**conda**](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) installed to manage the virtual environments

### Using pip

First, we create a conda virtual environment with:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomewalker/bam-filter/master/environment.yml
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then we proceed to install using pip:

```bash
pip install bam-filter
```

## Applications and recommendations

One of the main applications of **bam-filter** is to reliably identify which potential organisms are present in a metagenomic ancient sample, and get relatively accurate taxonomic abundances, even when they are present in very low abundances. The resulting BAM file then can be used as input for [metaDMG](https://metadmg-dev.github.io/metaDMG-core/). We rely on several measures to discriminate between noise and a potential signal, analyzing the mapping results at two different levels:

- Is the observed breadth aligned with the expected one?
- Are the reads spread evenly across the reference or they are clumped in a few regions?

To assess the first question we use the concepts defined [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/0888-7543(88)90007-9). We estimate the ratio between the observed and expected breadth as a function of the coverage. If we get a **breadth_exp_ratio** close to 1, it means that the coverage we observed is close to the one we expect based on the calculated coverage. While this measure is already a strong indicator of a potential signal, we complement it with the metrics that measure the **normalized positional entropy** and the **normalized distribution inequality** (Gini coefficient) of the positions in the coverage. For details on how are calculated check [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.918015/full). These two metrics will help to identify those cases where we get a high **breadth_exp_ratio** but the coverage is not evenly distributed across the reference but instead is clumped in a few regions. One thing to be aware of is that we need to bin the reference to calculate those metrics. In our case, we use the ability of [numpy.histogram](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.histogram.html) to identify the [numbers of bins](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.histogram_bin_edges.html#numpy.histogram_bin_edges), either using the Sturges or the Freedman-Diaconis rule. Finally, we use the [knee point detection algorithm](https://github.com/arvkevi/kneed) to identify the optimal values where to filter the Gini coefficient as a function of the positional entropy.
