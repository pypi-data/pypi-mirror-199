# pypeeve
PyPeeve is a python library for python pet peeves! As a developer, you know how time-consuming and tedious it can be to write the same boilerplate code over and over again. The aim of this library is to provide a tool that helps developers to reduce their unnecessary effort in writing boilerplate codes repeatedly in every project, allowing you to focus on what really matters - solving problems and building new features.

## Installation
To install the latest version, run-
```
pip install pypeeve

## Logger
Pypeeve provides a set of pre-configured loggers. The simplest and

a pre-configured logger that suit your need.

```python
from pypeeve.logger import logger

@logger.default
@logger.perf
def do_something():
    logger.info("Info logs")
    logger.error("Error logs")
```
