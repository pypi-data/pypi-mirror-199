# codetalk

Talk to your code!

## Setup
You will need a user token to use this project. Currently these are manually distributed; contact us and we'll supply you one.
Make sure you have libmagic installed. On macOS, that's `brew install libmagic`; Debian-based Linux, `apt install libmagic1 libmagic-dev`.

Once installed, run `codetalk`. There are a few built-in commands, which you can list with `help`.
