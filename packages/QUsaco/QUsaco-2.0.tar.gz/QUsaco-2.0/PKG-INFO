        Tired of USACO Judging being too slow/not working?
        
        Introducting Quick-USACO (QUsaco)! This allows you to compile and run your programs against their test cases with ease.
        
        - Multi-language support
        - Native Support for USACO Test Case Folders
        - Stress-testing for yourself too :D
        
        Test case folder should be formatted as:
        
        ```
        1.in
        1.out
        
        2.in
        2.out
        
        ...
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        USACO Quick Judge (stdin/stdout)
        
        positional arguments:
          ext         command to execute the compiled program
          test_dir    relative path of unzipped directory of USACO test
                      cases
        ```

        ## Plans
        
        - MLE Support
        - host test data so you don't have to download them
