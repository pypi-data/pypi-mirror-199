Description: # cpp_stresst
        
        This is a package to help stress test your C++ solutions to problems.
        
        You should have your directory structured like this:
        
        - C++ solution
        - Test Folder
        	- 1.in
        	- 1.out
        
        All test cases should have a file with the same name ending with `.in` and a file ending with `.out` for input and output, respectively.
        
        To test your solution on `stdin`/`stdout`, run this command.
        
        `c_stresst [SOLUTION FILE] [TEST FOLDER]`
        
        If you ever forget this command, simply type this into your terminal:
        `c_stresst --help`
        
        Only supported on linux systems (tested on Ubuntu), uses g++ to compile.
