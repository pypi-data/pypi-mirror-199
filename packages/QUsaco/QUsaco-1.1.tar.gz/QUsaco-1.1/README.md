# QUsaco

Tired of USACO Judging being too slow/not working?

Introducting Quick-USACO (QUsaco)! This allows you to compile and run your programs against their test cases with ease.

- Multi-language support
- Native Support for USACO Test Case Folders
- Stress-testing for yourself too :D

Test case folder should be formatted as:

```
1.in
1.out

2.in
2.out

...
```

## Usage

```
USACO Quick Judge (stdin/stdout)

positional arguments:
  ext         command to execute the compiled program
  test_dir    relative path of unzipped directory of USACO test
              cases
```

## Plans

- MLE Support
- host test data so you don't have to download them
