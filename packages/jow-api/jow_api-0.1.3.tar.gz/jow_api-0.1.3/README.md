# Jow API

This is a Python package that allows you to search for recipes on [Jow.fr](https://Jow.fr). The package provides an easy-to-use interface to search for recipes and fetch information about them.

## Installation

You can install the package using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) : 

```bash
pip install jow-api
```

## Usage
The package provides convenient functions for searching and obtaining recipe information. Here's an example:

```python
from jow_api import Jow

recipes = Jow.api_call("poulet",5)
readable_dict = recipes.get_info()

print(readable_dict)

```
The `api_call` function takes a search query as input, with an optional limit parameter,  and returns a Recipe object (basically the raw JSON response from the Jow.fr API). To obtain the recipe data in a more readable format, you can use the `get_info`  methods of the Recipe class provided by the package.

The `get_info` method returns a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a recipe. Each recipe dictionary contains the following keys :


* `id` : The ID of the recipe.
* `name` : The name of the recipe.
* `url` : The URL of the recipe on Jow.fr.
* `ingredients` : A list of dictionaries where each dictionary corresponds to an ingredient used in the recipe and contains the following keys:
    * `name` : The name of the ingredient.
    * `quantity` : The quantity of the ingredient needed for the recipe.
    * `unit` : The unit of measurement for the quantity of the ingredient.
    * `isOptional` : A boolean value indicating whether the ingredient is optional or not.
