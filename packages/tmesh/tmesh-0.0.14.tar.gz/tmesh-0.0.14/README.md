# tmesh

Fast operators for triangular meshes.

## Getting Started

`tmesh` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tmesh/):

```bash
pip install tmesh
```

See the [examples][examples-dir] directory to see how to use the package.

The following script demonstrates how to use the package to generate an
STL or OBJ file from a simple mesh:

```python
import math

from tmesh import regular_polygon_mesh, Affine2D, linear_extrude

# Create a cuboid.
a = regular_polygon_mesh(1.0, n=4)
b = regular_polygon_mesh(1.0, n=4)

# Move the second cuboid around.
rot = Affine2D(rot=math.pi / 4)
trans = Affine2D(trans=(0.0, 0.5))
b <<= rot @ trans

# Gets the union of A and B.
c = a | b

# Extrudes the 2D mesh to a 3D mesh with height 1.0.
mesh = linear_extrude(c, 1.0)

# Save the resulting mesh.
from tmesh import save_stl, save_stl_text, save_obj, save_ply

save_stl_text("simple_example_ascii.stl", mesh)
save_stl("simple_example.stl", mesh)
save_obj("simple_example.obj", mesh)
save_ply("simple_example.ply", mesh)
```

## Motivation

At various times I have wished there were something like [OpenSCAD][openscad] for Python. Packages like [trimesh][trimesh] exist, but they come with a number of clunky dependencies (including, interestingly enough, OpenSCAD itself). This package is a standalone implementation of the core functionality of OpenSCAD, but with a Pythonic API, making it easy to integrate into existing Python code. It is also written in pure C++, so it's hopefully relatively fast.
