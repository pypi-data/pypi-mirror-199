Utility to send an email to multiple addresses. Primarily intended for cli 
applications. The various fields such as server host, username, etc. are 
entered at the command line, used to construct a wmul_emailer.EmailSender 
object, and that object is passed into the main part of the script. 
The main part of the script can use it as needed to report errors or results 
without having to worry about the e-mail details.

============ Change Log ============
2023-Jan-17 = Changed License from GPLv2 to GPLv3. 

2023-Jan-13 = Added documentation. Allow caller to defer providing 
              from_email_address and destination_email_addresses until 
              send_email is called.

2022-May-06 = Changed License from MIT to GPLv2.

2018-May-23 = Reworked API to be class based.

2018-May-18 = Imported from Titanium_Monticello

              Fresh start, so no longer need two API endpoints for one function.

2017-Nov-15 = Bugfix for the destination email addresses not being a list.

2017-Nov-14 = Added SendEmailArguments to encapsulate the arguments and 
              send_email2 to consume those arguments.

2017-Jun-27 = Created.
