    '''
    Calculate the BackScatter-Based Index (BSI), Polarimetric BackScatter-Based Index (PBSI),
    or Co-Polarized Polarimetric BackScatter-Based Index (CPBSI) for a specific date and polygon in a
    Sentinel-1 image collection.
    
    - BSI (BackScatter Difference Index) measures the difference between the backscatter signal of the radar images
      pre and post-fertilization. After fertilization, the electrical properties of the soil and plants can change, 
      affecting the amount of backscatter signal received by the radar.
    - PBSI (Polarimetric BackScatter Index) is an index that measures signal polarization of radar images backscatter.
    - CPBSI (Cross-bias channel BackScatter Index) is an index that measures the amount of backscatter signal received
      by the image cross polarization channel radar.

    Args:
        image (ee.ImageCollection): The Sentinel-1 image collection filtered by date and bounds.
        date (pd.Timestamp): The acquisition date in Pandas Timestamp format.
        polygon (ee.Geometry): The field polygon geometry in Earth Engine format.
        type (str): The type of BSI to calculate: 'BSI' (default), 'P' or 'CP'.
    
    Returns:

    Calculate the Index of Variation of Roughness (TIRS) for a specific date and polygon in a

    TIRS (Index of Variation of Roughness) is an index that measures the variability of surface roughness
    in a given area, based on the difference between the backscatter signal of two perpendicular polarizations.
    It is an index that measures the change in soil roughness over time. After fertilization, the soil can become 
    more uniform, affecting the TIRS.
