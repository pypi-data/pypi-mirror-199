## Overview
This is a parser that extracts important information from a LinkedIn profile PDF. It converts the PDF to a list of strings, and then uses LinkedIn's headers to create a dictionary that maps said headers to string values that contain the most relevant parts of a candidate's profile.

## Installation
Install the library's dependencies and build the library using `make develop`.

## Accessing LinkedIn PDFs
Visit the LinkedIn profile that you would like to parse. Under the individual's basic profile information, there is a button labeled "More". Click on this button, and then click on "Save to PDF".

## Usage
In your code, begin by importing the package:

`from Resume-Parser import parser`

You can extract the text data from the PDF like so:

`data = parser.extract_pdf(<path_to_linkedin_pdf>)`

This parsed data can also be stored in a dictionary:

`res = parser.get_many(data)`
