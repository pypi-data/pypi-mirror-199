[![CodeStyle](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

This Python Module eases the handling of hdf5-recordings used by the [shepherd](https://github.com/orgua/shepherd)-testbed. Users can read, validate and create files and also extract, down-sample and plot information.

## Programming Interface

### Basic Usage (recommendation)

```python
import shepherd_data as shpd

with shpd.Reader("./hrv_sawtooth_1h.h5") as db:
    print(f"Mode: {db.get_mode()}")
    print(f"Window: {db.get_window_samples()}")
    print(f"Config: {db.get_config()}")
```

### Available Functionality

- `Reader()`
  - file can be checked for plausibility and validity (`is_valid()`)
  - internal structure of h5file (`get_metadata()` or `save_metadata()` ... to yaml) with lots of additional data
  - access data and various converters, calculators
    - `read_buffers()` -> generator that provides one buffer per call, can be configured on first call
    - `get_calibration_data()`
    - `get_windows_samples()`
    - `get_mode()`
    - `get_config()`
    - direct access to root h5-structure via `reader['element']`
    - converters for raw / physical units: `si_to_raw()` & `raw_to_si()`
    - `energy()` sums up recorded power over time
  - `downsample()` (if needed) visualize recording (`plot_to_file()`)
- `Writer()`
  - inherits all functionality from Reader
  - `append_iv_data_raw()`
  - `append_iv_data_si()`
  - `set_config()`
  - `set_windows_samples()`
- IVonne Reader
  - `convert_2_ivcurves()` converts ivonne-recording into a shepherd ivcurve
  - `upsample_2_isc_voc()` TODO: for now a upsampled but unusable version of samples of short-circuit-current and open-circuit-voltage
  - `convert_2_ivsamples()` already applies a simple harvesting-algo and creates ivsamples
- `./examples/`
  - `example_convert_ivonne.py` converts IVonne recording (`jogging_10m.iv`) to shepherd ivcurves, NOTE: slow implementation
  - `example_extract_logs.py` is analyzing all files in directory, saves logging-data and calculates cpu-load and data-rate
  - `example_generate_sawtooth.py` is using Writer to generate a 60s ramp with 1h repetition and uses Reader to dump metadata of that file
  - `example_plot_traces.py` demos some mpl-plots with various zoom levels
  - `example_repair_recordings.py` makes old recordings from shepherd 1.x fit for v2
  - `jogging_10m.iv`
      - 50 Hz measurement with Short-Circuit-Current and two other parameters
      - recorded with "IVonne"

## CLI-Interface

After installing the module the datalib offers some often needed functionality on the command line:

**Validate Recordings**

- takes a file or directory as an argument

```shell
shepherd-data validate dir_or_file

# examples:
shepherd-data validate ./
shepherd-data validate hrv_saw_1h.h5
```

**Extract IV-Samples to csv**

- takes a file or directory as an argument
- can take down-sample-factor as an argument

```shell
shepherd-data extract [-f ds-factor] [-s separator_symbol] dir_or_file

# examples:
shepherd-data extract ./
shepherd-data extract -f 1000 -s ; hrv_saw_1h.h5
```

**Extract meta-data and sys-logs**

- takes a file or directory as an argument

```shell
shepherd-data extract-meta dir_or_file

# examples:
shepherd-data extract-meta ./
shepherd-data extract-meta hrv_saw_1h.h5
```

**Plot IVSamples**

- takes a file or directory as an argument
- can take start- and end-time as an argument
- can take image-width and -height as an argument

```shell
shepherd-data plot [-s start_time] [-e end_time] [-w plot_width] [-h plot_height] [--multiplot] dir_or_file

# examples:
shepherd-data plot --multiplot ./
shepherd-data plot -s10 -e20 hrv_saw_1h.h5
```

**Downsample IVSamples (for later GUI-usage, TODO)**

- generates a set of downsamplings (20 kHz to 0.1 Hz in x4 to x5 Steps)
- takes a file or directory as an argument
- can take down-sample-factor as an argument

```shell
shepherd-data downsample [-f ds-factor] [-r sample-rate] dir_or_file

# examples:
shepherd-data downsample ./
shepherd-data downsample -f 1000 hrv_saw_1h.h5
shepherd-data downsample -r 100 hrv_saw_1h.h5
```

## Data-Layout and Design choices

Details about the file-structure can be found in the [main-project](https://github.com/orgua/shepherd/blob/main/docs/user/data_format.rst).

TODO:
- update design of file
- data dtype, mode, ...

### Modes and Datatypes

- Mode `harvester` recorded a harvesting-source like solar with one of various algorithms
  - Datatype `ivsample` is directly usable by shepherd, input for virtual source / converter
  - Datatype `ivcurve` is directly usable by shepherd, input for a virtual harvester (output are ivsamples)
  - Datatype `isc_voc` is specially for solar-cells and needs to be (at least) transformed into ivcurves later
- Mode `emulator` replayed a harvester-recording through a virtual converter and supplied a target while recording the power-consumption
  - Datatype `ivsample` is the only output of this mode

### Compression & Beaglebone

- supported are uncompressed, lzf and gzip with level 1 (order of recommendation)
  - lzf seems better-suited due to lower load, or if space isn't a constraint: uncompressed (None as argument)
  - note: lzf seems to cause trouble with some third party hdf5-tools
  - compression is a heavy load for the beaglebone, but it got more performant with recent python-versions
- size-experiment A: 24 h of ramping / sawtooth (data is repetitive with 1 minute ramp)
  - gzip-1: 49'646 MiB -> 588 KiB/s
  - lzf: 106'445 MiB -> 1262 KiB/s
  - uncompressed: 131'928 MiB -> 1564 KiB/s
- cpu-load-experiments (input is 24h sawtooth, python 3.10 with most recent libs as of 2022-04)
  - warning: gpio-traffic and other logging-data can cause lots of load

## Release-Procedure

- increase version number in __init__.py
- install and run pre-commit, for QA-Checks, see steps below
- every commit get automatically tested by Github
- put together a release on Github - the tag should match current version-number
- Github automatically pushes release to pypi

```shell
pip3 install pre-commit

pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Open Tasks

- [click progressbar](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/api/#click.progressbar) -> could replace tqdm
- implementations for this lib
  - generalize up- and down-sampling, use out_sample_rate instead of ds-factor
    - lib samplerate (tested) -> promising, but designed for float32 and range of +-1.0
    - lib resampy (tested) -> could be problematic with slice-iterator
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29085268/resample-a-numpy-array
    - scipy.signal.resample, https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.resample.html
    - scipy.signal.decimate, https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.decimate.html
    - scipy.signal.resample_poly, https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.resample_poly.html#scipy.signal.resample_poly
    - timestamps could be regenerated with np.arange( tmin, tmax, 1e9/samplerate)
  - generalize converters (currently in IVonne)
    - isc&voc <-> ivcurve
    - ivcurve -> ivsample
  - plotting and downsampling for IVCurves ()
  - plotting more generalized (power, cpu-util, ..., if IV then offer power as well)
  - some metadata is calculated wrong (non-scalar datasets)
  - unittests & codecoverage -> 79% with v22.5.4, https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html
    - test example: https://github.com/kvas-it/pytest-console-scripts
    - use coverage to test some edge-cases
  - sub-divide valid() into healthy()
  - add gain/factor to time, with repair-code
  - add https://pypi.org/project/nessie-recorder/#files
- main shepherd-code
  - proper validation first
  - update commentary
  - pin-description should be in yaml (and other descriptions for cpu, io, ...)
  - datatype-hint in h5-file (ivcurve, ivsample, isc_voc), add mechanism to prevent misuse
  - hostname for emulation
  - full and minimal config into h5
  - use the datalib as a base
  - isc-voc-harvesting
  - directly process isc-voc -> resample to ivcurve?
