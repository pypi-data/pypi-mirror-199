The \"chat\" command allows users to converse with GPT-3 by sending input from an input stream. The \"clear\" command clears any ongoing conversation history. The \"context\" command allows users to work with conversation context data.\n\nSome commands have additional sub-commands or options. For example, the \"chat\" command has a \"dump\" sub-command that dumps the cumulative conversation history to the terminal in a readable format.\n\nOverall, this HCLI template provides a structured way for users to interact with GPT-3 through a simple command-line interface."}, {"role": "user", "content": "sum up the conversation so far for context setting\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I am an AI language model and you asked me to explain a JSON file that defines the structure of an HCLI template for interacting with OpenAI's GPT-3 language model.

Such an API exposes a\"built-in\"\nCLI that can be interacted with dynamically with any HCLI client. Up to date, in-band, man page style API/CLI\ndocumentation is readily available for use to help understand how to interact with the API.\n\nMost, if not all, programming languages have a way to issue shell commands. With the help\nof a generic HCLI client, such as Huckle [1], APIs that make use of HCLI semantics are readily consumable\nanywhere via the familiar command line (CLI) mode of operation, and this, without there being a need to write\na custom and dedicated CLI to interact with a specific HCLI API.\n\nYou can find out more about HCLI on hcli.io [2]\n\nThe HCLI Internet-Draft [3] is a work in progress by the author and \nthe current implementation leverages hal+json alongside a static form of ALPS\n(semantic profile) [4] to help enable widespread cross media-type support.\n\nHelp shape HCLI and it's ecosystem on the discussion list [5] or by raising issues on github!\n\n[1] https://github.com/cometaj2/huckle\n\n[2] http://hcli.io\n\n[3] https://github.com/cometaj2/I-D/tree/master/hcli\n\n[4] http://alps.io\n\n[5] https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/huck-hypermedia-unified-cli-with-a-kick\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nhcli_core requires a supported version of Python and pip.\n\nYou'll need an WSGI compliant application server to run hcli_core. For example, you can use Green Unicorn (https://gunicorn.org/)\n\n    $ pip install gunicorn\n\nInstall hcli_core via pip. You can launch gunicorn from anywhere by using \"hcli_core path\". You can also look at the hcli_core help file:\n\n    $ pip install hcli_core\n\n    $ hcli_core help\n\n    $ gunicorn --workers=5 --threads=2 -b 127.0.0.1:8000 --chdir \\`hcli_core path\\` \"hcli_core:connector()\"\n\nIf you want to load a sample HCLI other than the default, you can try loading the sample hfm (hypertext file manager) HCLI.\nA folder path to any 3rd party HCLI can be provided in the same way:\n\n    $ gunicorn --workers=5 --threads=2 -b 127.0.0.1:8000 --chdir \\`hcli_core path\\` \"hcli_core:connector(\"\\\"\\\"\\`hcli_core sample hfm\\`\"\\\"\\\")\"\n\nCurl your new service to understand what is being exposed. The HCLI root URL, to use with an HCLI client, is the cli link relation:\n\n    $ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000\n\nInstall an HCLI client, for example Huckle (https://github.com/cometaj2/huckle), and access the default sample jsonf CLI\nexposed by HCLI Core (you may need to restart your terminal to be able to use jsonf by name directly; otherwise you can attempt\nto source ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc):\n\n    $ pip install huckle\n\n    $ huckle cli install http://127.0.0.1:8000\n\n    $ jsonf help\n\nYou can also look at the huckle help file:\n\n    $ huckle help\n\nBugs\n----\n\n- No good handling of control over request and response in cli code which can lead to exceptions and empty response client side.\n- The hfm sample HCLI fails disgracefully when copying a remote file name that doesn't exist (server error).\n\n.. |build status| image:: https://circleci.com/gh/cometaj2/hcli_core.svg?style=shield\n.. _build status: https://circleci.com/gh/cometaj2/huckle\n.. |pypi| image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/hcli-core.svg\n.. _pypi: https://badge.fury.io/py/hcli-core\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This file describes a Python package called HCLI Core, which provides an HCLI Connector that can be used to expose a REST API with a built-in CLI using hypertext command line interface (HCLI) semantics.
