----Question:

what is hcli?

----Answer:

HCLI stands for Hypertext Command Line Interface. It is a type of command line interface that allows developers to expose a service hosted CLI as a REST API, using hypertext semantics. HCLI provides a way to interact with APIs via the familiar command line interface (CLI) mode of operation, without needing to write custom and dedicated CLIs for each specific API. HCLI aims to enable widespread cross media-type support by leveraging hal+json alongside a static form of ALPS (semantic profile).
