Installing on Linux
===================

Review Board is most commonly used on Linux, and supports the latest versions
of most major Linux distributions.

In this guide, we'll show you how to install Review Board yourself on Linux.
This will require a compatible version of Python, and several system packages.

If you're looking for a different solution, you may consider:

* :ref:`Deploying using Docker <installation-docker>`
* `Hosting with us on RBCommons <RBCommons_>`_

If you need any assistance, `reach out to us for support <support_>`_.

Compatibility
=============


.. _supported-python:

Python
------

Review Board |version| supports Python |python_min_version| or higher.

If your Linux distribution does not come with a supported version of Python,
you may need to upgrade or look into a solution like :ref:`Docker
<installation-docker>`.

Alternatively, you can compile your own Python, along with mod_wsgi or
another server. This is only recommended if you're comfortable with this
process.


.. _supported-linux-distros:

Linux Distributions
-------------------

Review Board |version| is known to work with the following Linux
distributions:

* CentOS Stream 9
* Fedora 36
* Fedora 37
* Fedora 38
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 22.10 LTS

Other distributions may also work, as long as they provide a compatible
version of Python.

Review Board works on both X86 and ARM Linux distributions.

Preparing For Installation
==========================

Administrator Access
--------------------

The instructions below assume you're running as a superuser (``root``) or
will be using :command:`sudo`.

If you're installing into a Python virtual environment, you won't need to use
:command:`sudo` for any :command:`pip` commands.


.. _linux-http-proxy:

Using a HTTP Proxy
------------------

If you're behind a proxy server, you'll need to set the :envvar:`http_proxy`
environment variable to your proxy server before running :command:`pip`. This
must be done as the user running :command:`pip`, in the same shell. For
example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo -s
    $ export http_proxy=http://proxy.example.com/
    $ export https_proxy=https://proxy.example.com/
    $ pip3 install ....


Installing Required System Dependencies
=======================================

You will need to install a handful of dependencies required by Review Board.
Some of these are required to install Review Board's dependencies, and some
are required at runtime.

To install on Debian_ or Ubuntu_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ apt-get install build-essential python3-dev python3-pip \
                      libffi-dev libjpeg-dev libssl-dev patch \
                      libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libxmlsec1-openssl


To install on a `Red Hat Enterprise`_, Fedora_, or `CentOS Stream`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ yum install gcc python3-devel libffi-devel openssl-devel patch perl \
                  libxml2-devel xmlsec1-devel xmlsec1-openssl-devel
                  libtool-ltdl-devel


Installing Review Board
=======================

To install Review Board and its required dependencies in one go:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip3 install ReviewBoard


This will automatically download and install the latest stable release of
Review Board and the required versions of its core dependencies.

If you need to install a specific version:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip3 install ReviewBoard==<version>

   # For example:

.. note::

   Review Board previously supported an alternative to PySVN called
   Subvertpy. We've decided to drop Subvertpy support after many reports
   of compatibility issues.

   Subvertpy will continue to work through Review Board 5. However, we
   recommend uninstalling and upgrading to PySVN instead.

here.

After you've installed Review Board and created your site, you will need to
configure your authentication method. See the :ref:`authentication-settings`

=================================

Congratulations on installing Review Board!

The next step is to create a :term:`site directory`. This directory will
contain your configuration, data files, file attachments, static media files
(CSS, JavaScript, and images), and more.

You can have multiple site directories on the same server, each serving a
separate Review Board install.

Let's create your first site directory. Continue on to :ref:`creating-sites`.
