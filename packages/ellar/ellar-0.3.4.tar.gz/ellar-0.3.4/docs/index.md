## Introduction
Ellar is a lightweight ASGI framework for building efficient and scalable server-side python applications.
It supports both OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and FP (Functional Programming)


Ellar is built around [Starlette (ASGI toolkit)](https://www.starlette.io/) which processes all the HTTP requests and background tasks. Although, there is a high level 
of abstraction, some concepts of Starlette are still supported.

## Inspiration
Ellar was heavily inspired by [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/) in its simplicity in usage while managing complex project structures and applications. 
It also adopted some concepts of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) in handling request parameters and data serialization with pydantic.
With that said, the aim of Ellar focuses on a high level of abstraction of framework APIs, project structures, architectures, and speed of handling requests.

## Installation
To get started, you need to scaffold a project using [Ellar-CLI](https://eadwincode.github.io/ellar-cli/) toolkit. This is recommended for a first-time user.
The scaffolded project is more like a guide to project setup.

```shell
$(venv) pip install ellar[standard]
$(venv) ellar new project-name
```

### NB:
Some shells may treat square braces (`[` and `]`) as special characters. If that's the case here, then use a quote around the characters to prevent unexpected shell expansion.
```shell
pip install "ellar[standard]"
```

then, start the app with:
```shell
$(venv) ellar runserver --reload
```

Open your browser and navigate to [`http://localhost:8000/`](http://localhost:8000/).
