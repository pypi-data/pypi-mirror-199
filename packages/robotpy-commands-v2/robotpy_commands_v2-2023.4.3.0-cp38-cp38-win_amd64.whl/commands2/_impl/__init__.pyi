    A robot subsystem.  Subsystems are the basic unit of robot organization in
    the Command-based framework; they encapsulate low-level hardware objects
    (motor controllers, sensors, etc) and provide methods through which they can
    be used by Commands.  Subsystems are used by the CommandScheduler's resource
    management system to ensure multiple robot actions are not "fighting" over
    the same hardware; Commands that use a subsystem should include that
    subsystem in their GetRequirements() method, and resources used within a
    subsystem should generally remain encapsulated and not be shared by other
    parts of the robot.

    Subsystems must be registered with the scheduler with the
    CommandScheduler.RegisterSubsystem() method in order for the
    Periodic() method to be called.  It is recommended that this method be called
    from the constructor of users' Subsystem implementations.  The
    SubsystemBase class offers a simple base for user implementations
    that handles this.

    A command that uses two PID controllers (PIDController) and a profiled PID
    controller (ProfiledPIDController) to follow a trajectory (Trajectory) with a
    swerve drive.

    The command handles trajectory-following, Velocity PID calculations, and

    solution" that can be used by teams without a great deal of controls
    expertise.

    Advanced teams seeking more flexibility (for example, those who wish to
    use the onboard PID functionality of a "smart" motor controller) may use the
    secondary constructor that omits the PID and feedforward functionality,
    returning only the raw module states from the position PID controllers.

    The robot angle controller does not follow the angle given by
    the trajectory but rather goes to the angle given in the final state of the

    """
    A command that uses two PID controllers (PIDController) and a profiled PID
    controller (ProfiledPIDController) to follow a trajectory (Trajectory) with a
    swerve drive.

    The command handles trajectory-following, Velocity PID calculations, and
    feedforwards internally. This is intended to be a more-or-less "complete
    solution" that can be used by teams without a great deal of controls
    expertise.

    Advanced teams seeking more flexibility (for example, those who wish to
    use the onboard PID functionality of a "smart" motor controller) may use the
    secondary constructor that omits the PID and feedforward functionality,
    returning only the raw module states from the position PID controllers.

    The robot angle controller does not follow the angle given by
    the trajectory but rather goes to the angle given in the final state of the
    trajectory.
