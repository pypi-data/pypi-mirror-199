“Make your code tastier and serve your parameters with a nice DIP!”

## Introduction

DIPSL, or shorter DIP, is a serialization language for dimensional input parameters.
PyDIPSL is an implementation of DIP language for Python.
It was created in order to make initial conditions of physical codes easy to manage for developers and easier to type for users.
The most important features of DIP are:

* hierarchical structure of parameters
* validation of parameter values
* parameter referencing and value generation using expressions
* automatic conversion of physical units
