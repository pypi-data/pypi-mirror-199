        A local area network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building.
        By contrast, a wide area network (WAN) not only covers a larger geographic distance, but also generally involves leased telecommunication circuits.
        Ethernet and Wi-Fi are the two most common technologies in use for local area networks.
        Historical network technologies include ARCNET, Token Ring, and AppleTalk.
