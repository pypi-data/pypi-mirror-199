# **Fe**ature **S**election, **T**ransformation and **E**limination (FeSTE)

This repo contains the 'FeSTE' python package which helps in the features management from the pre-filtering to the pre-processing and feature elimination.

# Installation

The package is still not published. To install it:

1) **Optional**: create a new Python virtual environment (through bash terminal run: "py -m venv your_env_name" and then "source your_env_name/Scripts/activate )
2) Clone the repo: "git clone https://credem-data@dev.azure.com/credem-data/DAT/_git/FeSTE" (in case of issue a possible solution is to include "http.sslVerify=false" in the command)
3) Move to the folder "cd FeSTE"
4) Install the dependencies: "pip install -r requirements.txt  --trusted-host artifactory.group.credem.net  -i https://artifactory.group.credem.net/artifactory/api/pypi/virtualPypi/simple"
5) Install the package:
    - User Mode: "pip install ."
    - Developer Mode: "pip install -e ."

# Structure

The .py package is stored in src and contains 3 sub-modules:
- **selection**: contains the feature preliminary selection functions
- **transform**: contains the feature pre-processing functions
- **elimination**: contains the feature elimination functions

# Filters

## Selection

- Univariate filters:
    - No constant features
    - Number of distinct value too low
    - Number of missing values too high
    - Too concentrate in the most frequent value
    - Unstable between sets
- Multivariate filters:
    - Spearman Correlation for numerical features
    - Cramer's V for categorical features
    - R2 for mixed features
    - VIF
- Explanatory filters:
    - Feature AUROC for classification 
    - Feature Correlation with target for regression
    
## Elimination
- Shap Recursive Feature Elimination with HyperParam Optimization

# Trasformation

No function still included

# Additional

## Evaluation module
This module contains additional functions to plot results or evaluate models
