# PDFHarvester

PDFHarvester is a Python package for extracting tables, images, and keywords from PDF documents.

## Installation

You can install PDFHarvester using pip:

```sh
pip install PDFHarvester
```

# Usage

To extract tables, images, and keywords from a PDF document using PDFHarvester, you can use the following functions:

```
import pdfharvest as ph

tables = ph.extract_table('path/to/pdf')
images = ph.extract_images('path/to/pdf')
keywords = ph.extract_keywords('path/to/pdf')
```

`extract_table` returns a list of pandas dataframes, one for each table in the PDF. `extract_images` returns a list of images as numpy arrays, and `extract_keywords` returns a list of keywords as strings.
