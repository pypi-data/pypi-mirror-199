<!-- Summary -->
ChimeraPy is a distributed computing framework for multimodal data dollection, processing, and feedback. It's a real-time streaming tool that leverages from a distributed cluster to empower AI-driven applications.

1. **Collect** your data in real-time from any computer and time aligned it to the rest of your data streams.
2. **Process** data as soon as it comes, providing a service to your users.
3. **Archive** your outputs and later retrieve them in a single main data archive for later careful post-hoc analysis.
4. **Monitor** the executing of your distributed cluster, view live outputs, and verify that you collected clean data.
