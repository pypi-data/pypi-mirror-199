# expressGPT

expressGPT is a handy utility that allows you to run ChatGPT prompts in any window or application just by typing a simple keyword sequence. It provides a quick and convenient way to get assistance from ChatGPT, whether you're drafting an email, writing code, or even coming up with a flirty message for your partner.

## Features

- **Universal ChatGPT access**: Use ChatGPT in any window or application by typing `gpt:` followed by your query and ending the query with `:gpt`.
- **Versatile use cases**: Get help with various tasks, such as drafting emails in your mail app, writing code in a code editor, generating jokes, and more.


## Setup

You need to add your openAI API key and the modelname to the evironment variable:

#### Setting Environment Variables

To use expressGPT, you need to set up the following environment variables:

- `API_KEY_OPENAI`: Your OpenAI API key
- `CHATGPT_MODEL`: The ChatGPT model name for the [model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) you want to use (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`)

It is recommended to set the variables permanently for ease of use instead of setting them temporary.

You can follow [this](https://kb.wisc.edu/cae/page.php?id=24500) tutorial to setup the environment variable in Windows. 
Follow [this](https://devconnected.com/set-environment-variable-bash-how-to/#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20set%20a,to%20have%20this%20environment%20variable.) tutorial for setting the environment variable in Linux.
For Mac OS use [this](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/set-environment-variable-mac) .


## Installation

You can install expressGPT using pip:

```bash
pip install expressgpt
```

## Usage

Open a terminal and type:

```bash
expressgpt
```

The program will run and to use ChatGPT in any window or application, simply type `gpt:` followed by your query and end the query with `:gpt`. expressGPT will replace your query with ChatGPT's response.
For example, if you're in a text editor and you type:
```
gpt: Who was the winner of the first IPL season :gpt
```
expressGPT will replace the query with ChatGPT's response, like:
```
Rajasthan Royal won the first IPL season. 
```
