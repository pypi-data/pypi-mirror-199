"""
This module contains the code for the MainContext class. This class is
a context manager that supervises the execution of the main body of the process.

On entrance, it will verify the process manifest.

Upon exit, it will convert the step report into the run report. It will also
evaluate the ultimate status of the process—success if no exceptions were
raised, failure otherwise.

Without this context, the output manifest and run report would not be
generated at the end of the process.

    """
    Supervises an entire digital worker run and generates a work report
    and drift report for the run from the digital worker's manifest.

    You can optionally specify a callback function that will be run when
    this context is finished via the `callback` param in the constructor. A
    callback is a function that is invoked with two parameters: the
    current context (as the `MainContext` instance) and the `Report`
    generated from this digital worker's run.

    For example:

            ctx: MainContext,
            work_report: Report
