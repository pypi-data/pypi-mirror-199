# OpenShell

Welcome to OpenShell! This shell is different to others - instead of typing endless commands into a complicated terminal, you have all the power of Python at your fingertips!

OpenShell isn't just a Python interpreter, either. It's got an entire Python library behind it - designed specifically for the shell!
