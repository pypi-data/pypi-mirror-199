Tidy3D is a software product from Flexcompute that enables large scale electromagnetic simulation using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method.

This repository stores the python interface for Tidy3d.

This code allows you to:
* Programmatically define FDTD simulations.
* Submit and magange simulations running on Flexcompute's servers.
* Download and postprocess the results from the simulations.

You can find a detailed documentation and API reference [here](https://flexcompute-tidy3ddocumentation.readthedocs-hosted.com/).
The source code for our documentation is [here](https://github.com/flexcompute-readthedocs/tidy3d-docs).

## Installation

### Signing up for tidy3d

Note that while this front end package is open source, to run simulations on Flexcompute servers requires an account with credits.
You can sign up [here](https://client.simulation.cloud/register-waiting).  While it's currently a waitlist for new users, we will be rolling out to many more users in the coming weeks!  See [this page](https://flexcompute-tidy3ddocumentation.readthedocs-hosted.com/quickstart.html) in our documentation for more details.

### Installing the front end 

#### Using pip (recommended)

The easiest way to install tidy3d is through [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```
pip install tidy3d
```

This will install the latest stable version, to get the a "pre-release" version.

```
pip install --pre tidy3d
```

And to get a specific version `x.y.z`

```
pip install tidy3d==x.y.z
```

### Installing on Windows

Pre-release `1.9.0rc1` introduces the `adjoint` plugin, which uses [jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for automatic differentiation of tidy3d simulations. As windows users may have trouble installing `jax`, the recommended approach is to use [jax-windows-builder](https://github.com/cloudhan/jax-windows-builder) to first install jaxlib before tidy3d.

```
pip install "jax[cpu]===0.3.14" -f https://whls.blob.core.windows.net/unstable/index.html --use-deprecated legacy-resolver
pip install tidy3d
```

More details can be found [here](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer.html#additional-notes-for-building-jaxlib-from-source-on-windows).


### Installing from source

For development purposes, and to get the latest development versions, you can download and install the package from source as:

```
git clone https://github.com/flexcompute/tidy3d.git
cd tidy3d
pip install -e .
```

### Configuring and authentication

Authentication (linking the front end to your account) will be done via an API key moving forward.

You can find your API key in the [web interface](ehttp://tidy3d.simulation.cloud)

After signing in and navigating to the account page by clicking the "user" icon on the left-hand side, copy the API key from the button on the right-hand side of the page.

To set up the API key to work with Tidy3D, we need to store it either in the `~/.tidy3d/config` file or an environment variable.

You can set it up using one of three following options.

#### Command line (recommended)

``tidy3d configure`` and then enter your API key when prompted.

Note that Windows users must run the following instead (ideally in an anaconda prompt):

```
pip install pipx
pipx run tidy3d configure
```

#### Manually

For an API key of `{your_api_key}`, you may run

``echo 'apikey = "{your_api_key}"' > ~/.tidy3d/config``

or manually insert the line `'apikey = "{your_api_key}"` in the `~/.tidy3d/config` file.

#### Environment Variable

Set the `SIMCLOUD_APIKEY` environment variable to your API key (in quotes).

``export SIMCLOUD_APIKEY="{your_api_key}"``

### Testing the installation and authentication

#### Front end package

You can verify the front end installation worked by running:

```
python -c "import tidy3d as td; print(td.__version__)"
```

and it should print out the version number, for example:

```
1.0.0
```

#### Authentication

To test the web / authentication

```
python -c "import tidy3d.web"
```
