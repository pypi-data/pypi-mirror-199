# Streamlit Named Entity Recognition (NER) Annotation component

This is a component to assist with the annotation of *named entities* in an unstructured piece of text. The concept for this is borrowed from what is offered by [Prodi.gy](https://prodi.gy/). This code is derived from the work done by [andfalino](https://github.com/andfanilo) in his excellent [streamlit-named-entity-svelte](https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-named-entity-svelte) repository.

The functionality has been expanded to allow for selecting of new entities and uses the [streamlit-component-svelte-template](https://github.com/93degree/streamlit-component-svelte-template).

I am also using this component as a testbed to get familiar with streamlit custom components and svelte.
