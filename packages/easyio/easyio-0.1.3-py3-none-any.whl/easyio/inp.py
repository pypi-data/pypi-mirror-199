'''
Helper functions for easy input.

This module contains helper functions that make input in 
python easier.

NOTE: If you import this package using 
"from easyio.inp import *", the built-in input() function 
will be overwritten with the input() function from this 
package.

def input (prompt=None, /, *, sep=' ', file=None, type=str):
    '''
    Read a line of input.

    The prompt string, if given, is printed to the console 
    before reading input.

    The sep parameter, which defaults to a single space is 
    what is printed after the prompt, but before the input 
    is retrieved.  If no prompt is given, this is not 
    printed.

    The file can be any file-like object that has a 
    .readline() method.  If no file is given, input is 
    retrieved from the standard input stream (stuff typed 
    into the console).  If a file is given, the prompt and 
    sep are not printed.

    The input value can be converted to any type using the 
    type parameter.  This needs to be a function that takes 
    a string and converts it to the desired type (e.g. int, 
    float, number, etc.)

def inputs (prompt=None, /, quant=None, *, sep=' ', file=None, type=str):
    '''
    Read multiple lines of input.  You can specify quant
    as the number you want to read.  If quant is not given
    the function will keep reading inputs until a blank line
    if input.

    The prompt string, if given, is printed to the console 
    before reading each line of input.

    Any keyword arguments (e.g. file, sep, type) will be
    forwarded to the input() function.

    When reading from a file, the end of the inputs is the
    end of the file, not a blank line.
