# FactorialHR work time verification

This script verifies attendances whether they comply with german law. In particular, the following rules are verified:
- Whether the work time is longer than 6 hours without a break of 30 min
- Whether the work time is longer than 9 hours without a break of 45 min
- Whether the work time is longer than 10 hours without a break of 11 hours

It also provides a way to fetch the attendances of all employees from [FactorialHR](https://apidoc.factorialhr.com/docs) using a [company api-key](https://help.factorialhr.com/how-to-create-api-keys-in-factorial). Its then printed nicely to the console using [tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/).
