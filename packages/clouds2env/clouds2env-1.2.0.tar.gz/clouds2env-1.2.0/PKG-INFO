============
 clouds2env
============

A tool to convert from an OpenStack ``clouds.yaml`` file to environment
variables. This can be useful when all you have is a ``clouds.yaml`` file but
you need to work with a legacy tool like *novaclient*.

Like *openstacksdk*, *clouds2env* will look in the following location for
``clouds.yaml`` files:

* ``.`` (the current directory)
* ``$HOME/.config/openstack``
* ``/etc/openstack``

The first file found wins.

You can also set the environment variable ``OS_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE`` to an
absolute path of a file to look for and that location will be inserted at the
front of the file search list.

You can specify the cloud to generate environment variables for by setting the
``OS_CLOUD`` environment variable. Alternatively, you may provide the cloud
name as an argument to tool.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: shell

    $ clouds2env --help
    usage: clouds2env [-h] [--set | --unset] [cloud]
