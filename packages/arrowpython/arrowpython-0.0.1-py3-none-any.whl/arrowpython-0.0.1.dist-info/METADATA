# ArrowPython

A programming language that transpiles to python. It has extremely similar syntax, but instead of colons (`:`),
you use arrows (`=>`). Along with this, you are also able to call functions with only one argument with the following syntax:
```python
function:argument
```
This allows for statements such as this in ArrowPython:
```python
print:"hello"
```
or:
```python
str:1234
```
It allows you to call single-argument functions whilst shortening the time it takes to write them.

To use arrow python, first install it using:
```shell
pip3 install arrowpython
```

Then, to use it in your program, create a new python file and before putting in any code write:
```python
import arrowpython
```

An example of the popular FizzBuzz program in ArrowPython:
```python
import arrowpython

def fizbuzz:num =>
    for fizzbuzz in range:num =>
        if fizzbuzz % 3 == 0 and fizzbuzz % 5 == 0 =>
            print:"fizzbuzz"
            continue
        elif fizzbuzz % 3 == 0 =>
            print:"fizz"
            continue
        elif fizzbuzz % 5 == 0 =>
            print:"buzz"
            continue
        print:fizzbuzz

fizbuzz:51
```

Have fun coding.
