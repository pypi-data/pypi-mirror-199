PyGIRAFE stands for Python Graphical Interface to Run Analyses Flexibly and Easily

It's a Python graphical interface aimed for facilitating the analyses of data. 

Our goal is to provide an easy-to-use GUI that allows to load your data, filter them and fine-tuned your analyses parameters. 

The analysis parameters are easy to set through our GUI and can be saved and re-used any time.
Each time, a log file and all parameters are saved to improve reproducibility.

The toolbox was designed to be flexible. Thus adding a new analysis is done easily in a plugin way.

Different formats of data can be added easily, as we used a wrapper system.

PyGIRAFE is under development. The version published is an alpha version and the documentation is still not complete.
Don't hesitate to contact us if you want more information.

Documentation of PyGIRAFE will be soon available at this address `here <https://pygirafe.readthedocs.io/>`_.

---------------
Personalisation
---------------

To create a new analysis wrapper:
Create a class that inherit from GirafeAnalysisFormatWrapper

To get new option to group data, implement the static function grouped_by() in your analysis wrapper

To implement new analysis, create classes that inherit GirafeAnalysis.

Then in config.yaml indicate with the variable data_files_dir_names then the DATA_FORMAT (replace by the name of your data_format)
