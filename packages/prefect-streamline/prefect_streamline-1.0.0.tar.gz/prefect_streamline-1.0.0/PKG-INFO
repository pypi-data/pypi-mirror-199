``prefect_streamline`` allows you to configure the deployment of flows with a decorator.
Vous pouvez définir plusieurs déploiements pour un même flow.

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_streamline import deploybook

@deploybook.register(interval=90, name="hello2")
@deploybook.register(cron="*/3 * * * *")
@deploybook.register(name="manual")
@flow(name="main.myflow")
def myflow() -> int:
    return 43
```

the prefect-streamline cli browses all the subfolders of your application.

```bash
# deploy all the flows register into myapp/flow.py
prefect-streamline deploy myapp/flow.py

# search all flow records in all myapp modules.
prefect-streamline deploy --discover src/myapp
```
