## Typing stubs for vobject

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `vobject` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`vobject`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/vobject. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `87c1b949cdf996148e44fb913a1b689f8d337a5a`.
