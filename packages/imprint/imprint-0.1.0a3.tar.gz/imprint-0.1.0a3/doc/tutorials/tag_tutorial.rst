Making Your Tag Built-In
------------------------

If you end up writing a tag that you believe is generic and useful enough to be
built-in, feel free to submit a `merge request`_ or patch to the author. Be sure
to include all, or at least most, of the following items:

  - A properly documented implementation of your tag in the
    :py:mod:`imprint.core.tags` module.
  - A proper entry in :doc:`/reference/xml_spec`.
  - At least a brief mention of your tag in at least one of the tutorials.
  - Proper tests, once that becomes a thing.
