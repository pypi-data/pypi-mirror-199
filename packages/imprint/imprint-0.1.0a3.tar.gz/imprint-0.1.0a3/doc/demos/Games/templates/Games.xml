        The following images show the boards used by different types of gridded
        games. <figure-ref id="checkers"/> and <figure-ref id="chess"/> show
        checkers and chess, respectively. These are some of the most common
        games played on a static pre-made board. <figure-ref id="tic_tac_toe"/>
        and <figure-ref id="battleship"/> show tic-tac-toe and battleship
        boards. These are no less ubiquitous, but are generally played on
        hand-drawn boards.

        This section lists games played on hand-drawn paper "boards".
        While pre-made board versions of these games exist, they are
        traditionally played on paper. For strictly board-type games, see
        <segment-ref title="Board Games"/>.
