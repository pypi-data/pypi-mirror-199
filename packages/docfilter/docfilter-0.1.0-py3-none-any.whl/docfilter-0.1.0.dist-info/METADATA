# Python Package: Filter
The Python package `filter` is used to detect and remove inappropriate information from text.

# Installation
```
pip install filter
```

# Features
1. `Regular expression filtering` This method is used to find and filter out specific string patterns, such as personal information like phone numbers or email addresses, or words and phrases related to profanity.
2. `Dictionary-based filtering` This method is used to filter out words that match with profanity or personal information already listed in a pre-built dictionary. While this method is quick to apply, it has the disadvantage of needing to be updated with new profanity or personal information.
3. `Machine learning-based filtering` This method uses a machine learning model to identify sentences related to profanity or personal information. While this method is more accurate than others, it requires a lot of time and resources to train the model.
4. `Special character removal` This method is used to remove special characters from strings that may contain personal information, such as phone numbers or email addresses. While this method is quick to apply, it may be difficult to handle exceptional cases.

One or a combination of the above methods can be used to implement an appropriate filtering method depending on the requirements of the application, and it should be validated in terms of performance and security.
