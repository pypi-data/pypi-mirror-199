## Typing stubs for pyRFC3339

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `pyRFC3339` package. It

[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`pyRFC3339`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/pyRFC3339. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.
