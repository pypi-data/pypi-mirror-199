## How make push
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24114676/git-error-failed-to-push-some-refs-to-remote

If the GitHub repo has seen new commits pushed to it, while you were working locally, I would advise using:
```commandline
git pull --rebase
git push
```
The full syntax is:
```commandline
git pull --rebase origin main
git push origin main
```
## How build library
```
 python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
 twine upload --repository testpypi dist/* --config-file <path to>.pypirc #test pypi
 twine upload dist/* --config-file <path to>.pypirc #test pypi #regular pypi
```
