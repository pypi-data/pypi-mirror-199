===================
 OCP Network Split
===================

Project ``ocp-network-split`` provides functionality to block (and unblock)
network traffic between `OpenShift 4`_ cluster zones and to optionally create
additional network latency among all zones. It's intended to be used for
*testing purposes* only. The feature can be used either via command line tools
or a python module.

This is useful when you need to separate network between given zones for
*testing purposes*, without affecting other traffic and with no assumptions
about networking configuration of the platform the cluster is deployed on
(under normal conditions, network separation like this could be done by
tweaking network components between zones).
