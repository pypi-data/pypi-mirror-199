Preprocessor
*****


Preprocessor is a preprocessing library for tweet data written in
Python. When building Machine Learning systems based on tweet and text data, a
preprocessing is required. This is required because of quality of the data as well as dimensionality reduction purposes. 

This library makes it easy to clean the tweets so you don't have to write the same helper functions over and over again ever time.
