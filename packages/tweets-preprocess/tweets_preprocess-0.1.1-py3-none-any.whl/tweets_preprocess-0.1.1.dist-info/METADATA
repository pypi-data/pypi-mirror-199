Preprocessor

*****





Preprocessor is a preprocessing library for tweet data written in

Python. When building Machine Learning systems based on tweet and text data, a

preprocessing is required. This is required because of quality of the data as well as dimensionality reduction purposes. 



This library makes it easy to clean the tweets so you don't have to write the same helper functions over and over again ever time.



Features

========



Currently supports cleaning :



-  URLs

-  Hashtags

-  Mentions

-  Emojis

-  Smileys

-  ``.csv`` and ``.xlsx`` file support



Preprocessor ``v0.1.1`` supports

``Python 3.9+ on Windows``. 



Usage

=====



Basic cleaning:

---------------



.. code:: python

    

    >>># Import Preprocess from your library

    >>>from tweets-preprocess import Preprocess

    >>>import pandas as pd

    >>>import numpy as np



    >>># Instantiate a Preprocess object

    >>>data = pd.read_excel(r"D:\Ipac_new\My_Python_Lib\tweet_preprocess\sample.xlsx")

    >>>data['pre_text'] = ""



    >>>p = Preprocess(data,'Text')

    >>>d = p.process()



    >>>data['pre_text'] = pd.Series(d)



    >>>d1 = data.loc[data['pre_text']!='']

    >>>#save cleaned tweets to csv file

    d1.to_csv('pre-data.csv')

    

    

 Example:   

 Raw Tweet: 'Preprocessor is #awesome üëç https://github.com/anusha-ipac/tweets_preprocess'  

 Cleaned Tweet: 'Preprocessor is'   





Processing files:

formats.
