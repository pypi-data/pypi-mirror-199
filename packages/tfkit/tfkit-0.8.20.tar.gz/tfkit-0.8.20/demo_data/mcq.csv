"I 'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars , Jurassic Park , Multiplicity , or many of the other movies that describe cloning . Most of what you see in these movies is false . What you do n't know is that cloning could be dangerous , to the clone and to our society as a whole . I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons . What about identity ? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities . What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else 's genetic identity ? True , Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities . Also , these is a large power struggle here . Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person 's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities . The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have . Cloning would also deal with killing embryos   . You might not have known , but Dolly , the sheep that was cloned in 1996 , was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived . The rest died or were thrown away . Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans . cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone , at this present time , would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone . In studies done on cows , 4 out of 12 birth mothers died . There is a very high failure rate , which is shown in the cloning of Dolly . Even if you had a few good embryos , failures have been noticeable in animal tests . So , should we work ahead in the world of cloning ? I say no . the risks are greater than the benefits . It 's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother . We would be killing human lives in the process . It would also be a violation   of the clone 's right to its own genetic identity and personality . </s> According to the article , what is the author 's opinion about identity ? [MASK] People 's identity is completely determined by their genes . [MASK] Government has the rights to confirm people 's identities . [MASK] Cloning itself gives parents great power over identity . [MASK] Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities .",3
