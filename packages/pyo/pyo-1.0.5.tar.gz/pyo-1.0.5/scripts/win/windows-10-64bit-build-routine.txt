=== STEP 1 ===
--- Install msys2 64-bit and update it

=== STEP 2 ===
--- Install msys2 packages (pacman -S package_name)

* setup.py file assumes that msys2 is installed on the default location. If
not, you'll have to change the paths in include_dirs and library_dirs to
reflect your installation.

mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
make
autoconf
automake
libtool
subversion

=== STEP 3 ===
Add the MinGW and MSYS2 bin dirs to your Windows PATH:

Open System Properties, click Environment Variables,
Then edit the system Path variable. Add these two paths in this order:

C:\msys64\mingw64\bin  
C:\msys64\usr\bin  

=== STEP 4 ===
--- Install Git
https://git-scm.com/download/win

=== STEP 5 ===
--- Install Visual Studio Community 2022

=== STEP 6 ===
--- Clone vcpkg repo and bootstrap it.

=== STEP 7 ===
From vcpkg repo, install portaudio, portmidi, libsndfile, liblo and pthreads

=== STEP 8 ===
--- Install Python 3.7+ 64-bit.
--- Add PythonXX and PythonXX\Scripts paths to environment variables.
 
=== STEP 9 ===
--- Copy PythonXX/vcruntime140.dll in PythonXX/libs/

=== STEP 10 ===
--- Patch PythonXX/Lib/distutils/cygwinccompiler.py to add missing msc_ver:
    
    elif msc_ver == "1700":
        return ['msvcr110']
    elif msc_ver == "1800":
        return ['msvcr120']
    elif msc_ver.startswith("19"):
        return ['vcruntime140']

=== STEP 11 ===
Update python modules (for all python versions)

py -3.x -m pip install -U pip wheel wxPython 

=== STEP 12 ===
--- Download pyo sources from git and build it with (in a standard command prompt):

py -X.X setup.py install --use-double
