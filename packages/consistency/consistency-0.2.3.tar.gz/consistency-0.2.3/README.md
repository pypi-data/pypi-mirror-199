**Consistency Models** are a new family of generative models that achieve high sample quality without adversarial training. They support _fast one-step generation_ by design, while still allowing for few-step sampling to trade compute for sample quality.

## Installation

```sh
$ pip install consistency
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from diffusers import UNet2DModel
from consistency import Consistency

consistency = Consistency(
    model=UNet2DModel(sample_size=224),
    learning_rate=1e-4,
)

samples = consistency.sample(16)

# multi-step sampling, sample from the ema model
samples = consistency.sample(16, steps=5, use_ema=True)
```

`Consistency` is self-contained with the training logic and all necessary schedules. It subclasses `LightningModule`, so it's supposed to be used with `Trainer`.

```python
from pytorch_lightning import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(max_epochs=8000, accelerator="auto")
trainer.fit(consistency, some_dataloader)
```
