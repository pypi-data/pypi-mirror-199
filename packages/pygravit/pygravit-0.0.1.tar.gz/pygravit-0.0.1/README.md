```
4. Check out the documentation for further work.


## Documentation
### 1. Examples
**api_gravitpy_example.py**
```python
from pygravit import PyGravit

# Connecting to a database
GravitLauncher = PyGravit(db="dbname", host="ip/domainname", port=3306, user="username", passwd="password", table="tablename (default users)")

# Creating a player in the database
GravitLauncher.player_create("Nickname", "Password")

# Removing a player from the database
GravitLauncher.player_delete("Nickname")

# Changing the player (the parameters are in the GravitLauncher documentation as well as in the database itself)
GravitLauncher.player_change("Nickname", "Param", "Value")

# Getting the player parameter (the parameters are in the GravitLauncher documentation as well as in the database itself)
GravitLauncher.player_get("Nickname", "Param")
```

**custom_tablename.py**
```python
from pygravit import PyGravit

GravitLauncher = PyGravit(db="dbname",
                                host="ip/domainname",
                                port=3306,

                                table="server_users" ) #table default "users"

# Creating two tables: server_users and server_users_hwids (default: users and users_hwids)
```

**except_processing.py**
```python
from pygravit import PyGravit
from pygravit import (DatabaseConnectionError, NicknameInDatabaseError, NicknameNotInDatabaseError,
                                AllowedCharactersNicknameError, ClassDatabaseNotConnectionError, NicknameLengthError,
                                ParamNotFoundError, DataError)
try:
    GravitLauncher = PyGravit(db="dbname", host="ip/domainname", port=3306, user="username", passwd="password", table="tablename (default users)")
except DatabaseConnectionError as e: 
    print(e)

try:
    GravitLauncher.player_create("Nickname", "Password")
except (NicknameInDatabaseError or AllowedCharactersNicknameError or NicknameLengthError or DataError or ClassDatabaseNotConnectionError) as e:
    print(e)

try:
    GravitLauncher.player_delete("Nickname")
except (NicknameNotInDatabaseError or DataError or ClassDatabaseNotConnectionError) as e:
    print(e)

try:
    GravitLauncher.player_change("Nickname", "Param", "Value")
    GravitLauncher.player_get("Nickname", "Param")
except (NicknameNotInDatabaseError or ParamNotFoundError or DataError or ClassDatabaseNotConnectionError) as e:
    print(e)
```
