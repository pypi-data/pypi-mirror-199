The Zenseact Open Dataset (ZOD) is a large multi-modal autonomous driving dataset developed by a team of researchers at [Zenseact](https://zenseact.com/). The dataset is split into three categories: *Frames*, *Sequences*, and *Drives*. For more information about the dataset, please refer to our [coming soon](), or visit our [website](https://zod.zenseact.com).

## Examples
Find examples of how to use the dataset in the [examples](examples/) folder. Here you will find a set of jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use the dataset, as well as an example of how to train an object detection model using [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2).

## Installation

The install the library with minimal dependencies, for instance to be used in a training environment without need for interactivity och visualization, run:
```bash
pip install zod
```

To install the library along with the CLI, which can be used to download the dataset, convert between formats, and perform visualization, run:
```bash
pip install "zod[cli]"
```

To install the full devkit, with the CLI and all dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install "zod[all]"
```

## Download using the CLI

This is an example of how to download the ZOD Frames mini-dataset using the CLI. Prerequisites are that you have applied for access and received a download link. To download the mini-dataset, run:
```bash
zod download --url "<download-link>" --output-dir <path/to/outputdir> frames --mini
```
similarly, to download the full dataset (including all lidar scans before and after the keyframe), run:
```bash
zod download --url "<download-link>" --output-dir <path/to/outputdir> frames --lidar --num-scans-before -1 --num-scans-after -1 --oxts --images --blur --dnat --calibrations --annotations
```
this will download all the previous and future lidar scans (as `num-scans-before=-1` and `num-scans-after=-1`), the OxTS data, the images (with both the blur and DNAT anonymization), the calibration files, the annotations, and all other necessary files. If you dont want any previous or future lidar scans, run:
```bash
zod download --url "<download-link>" --output-dir <path/to/outputdir> frames --lidar --num-scans-before 0 --num-scans-after 0 --oxts --images --blur --dnat --calibrations --annotations
```

For a full list of options for ZOD download, run:
```bash
zod download --help
zod download --url="<url>" --output-dir=<dir> frames --help
zod download --url="<url>" --output-dir=<dir> sequences --help
```
depending on which dataset you want to download.


## Anonymization
To preserve privacy, the dataset is anonymized. The anonymization is performed by [brighterAI](https://brighter.ai/), and we provide two separate modes of anonymization: deep fakes (DNAT) and blur. In our paper, we show that the performance of an object detector is not affected by the anonymization method. For more details regarding this experiment, please refer to our [coming soon]().
