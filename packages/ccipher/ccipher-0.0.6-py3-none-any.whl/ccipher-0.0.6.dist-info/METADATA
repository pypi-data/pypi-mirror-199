# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that shifts each letter in a message by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This package provides a Python implementation of the Caesar cipher for encrypting messages with a key.

## Installation

To install the package, run:

pip install ccipher

## Usage

To use the Caesar cipher to encrypt a message, import the `ccipher` module and call the `encrypt` function with the message and the key as arguments:

```python
from ccipher import encrypt

message = "hello world"
key = 3
encrypted_message = encrypt(message, key)
print(encrypted_message)
```

This will output the encrypted message "khoor zruog".

To decrypt a message that has been encrypted with the Caesar cipher, call the decrypt function with the encrypted message and the key as arguments:

```python
from ccipher import decrypt

encrypted_message = "khoor zruog"
key = 3
decrypted_message = decrypt(encrypted_message, key)
print(decrypted_message)
```

This will output the original message "hello world".
