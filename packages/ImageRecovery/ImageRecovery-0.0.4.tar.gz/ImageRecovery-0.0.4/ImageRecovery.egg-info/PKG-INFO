Staged Image Recovery uses a combination of structural embedding and manifold learning to recover images from proximity information. Such information is encoded in a graph, where edges denote proximity. Although the problem to be solved is quite general, it has special relevancein the context of DNA sequencing-based microscopy.For more information, please read our paper:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.29.510142v1
