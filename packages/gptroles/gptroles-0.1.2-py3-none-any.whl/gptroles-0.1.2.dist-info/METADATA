#### Roleplayer
It has a "roleplaying" root prompt that attempts to make implementing more roles into ChatGPT easier.
You can add "roles" to the root prompt, by default there are some roles related to commands and programming.

You can also change the root prompt to something else entirely, there's a list of some prompts that are sourced online, see features.

###### Command Role

-- GPT can request web pages or from APIs to answer your questions, to get current prices or latest news, these requests will be hidden from the chat and passed to ChatGPT which will then use it to answer your question

-- Provide basic shell commands that will be automatically be run, to find or list files etc

-- Instructions to format markdown for the programming features

#### App Features
