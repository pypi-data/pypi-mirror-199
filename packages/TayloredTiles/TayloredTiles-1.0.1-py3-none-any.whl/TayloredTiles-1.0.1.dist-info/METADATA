- Created By Jacob H Barrow

# In Development
## Information
- Built the logic and have a working tkinter interface
- Need to debug for errors (only spent about 4 hours on it!)
- Need to implement extensions

## What is Taylored Tiles
- It's a spin-off from popular games that works with Taylor Sequences instead of words

## Why this game?
- Some people are visual learners, some need to get hands one, others are purely mathematical

## Who is this for?
- The people that develop our software, deploy our architectures, and monitor our networks
- Mainly for people whose first languages are not human, but instead, computer-based
- Who doesn't speak a human language??? Dumbledore's Army!!!

## Usage
``` python
>>> from TayloredTiles import TayloredTiles
>>> root = tk.Tk()
>>> tiles = TayloredTiles(root)
>>> tiles.set_grid()
>>> root.mainloop()
```

### Shout Out
- To my friends at the NSA: even though they undervalue us, we will still thrive!!
- Just imagine if we weren't burdened with corruption
- Long live the enterprise: spock out!
