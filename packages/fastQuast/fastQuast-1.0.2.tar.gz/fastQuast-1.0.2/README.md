# FastQuast: Fast and simple Quality Assessment Tool for Large Genomes

This Python program is a fast and simple quality assessment tool for genome assemblies. It calculates various assembly statistics such as N50, L50, N75, L75, and the number of N's per 100 kbp for each input file containing contigs or scaffolds. The program accepts a list of files with contigs, allows for optional splitting of scaffolds by continuous fragments of N's, and provides the ability to set a lower threshold for contig length. Users can also specify custom labels for each assembly and choose the output directory for the results. The results are presented in a tabular format, which can be saved as a TSV file if desired.
