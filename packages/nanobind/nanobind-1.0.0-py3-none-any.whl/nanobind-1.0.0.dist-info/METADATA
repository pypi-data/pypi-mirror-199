_nanobind_ is a small binding library that exposes C++ types in Python and
vice versa. It is reminiscent of
_[Boost.Python](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/libs/python/doc/html)_
and _[pybind11](http://github.com/pybind/pybind11)_ and uses near-identical
syntax. In contrast to these existing tools, _nanobind_ is more _efficient_:
bindings compile in a shorter amount of time, produce smaller binaries, and
have better runtime performance.
