# Portfolio Optimization Experiments

I've been interested in finance for a long time, but I've never had the
opportunity to learn about it in a structured way. This idea came to me
after a twitter mutual mentioned that french state pensions had to be better
in terms of revenue for middle class people compared to S&P 500. I was curious
about how to compare the two, and I started to learn about financial concepts
such as volatility, risk, and return. I also wanted to learn about how to compare
metrics such as the IRR via the Sharpe ratio, and how to compare risk-free assets
such as french pensions to risky assets such as S&P 500.

The experiments can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/arnos-stuff/portfolios),
and the results are published in sections of [my optimization book](https://optim.arnov.dev)
(which is also open source).

## Main tools (for now)

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org/)
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)

## Upcoming experiments

- Model the french pension system as an asset & compare it to S&P 500
- Estimate risk aversion from historical data
- Calculate the tradeoff curve for the french pension system
