# Pysura - BETA

### Hasura + Python = Pysura

```commandline
pip install pysura
pysura
(pysura_cli) >>> setup_hasura
```
Note: The installer is doing a lot of things. Some of them take a long time, like
creating databases, firewalls, and VPC networks. Sometimes it might look frozen,
but give it some time to do its thing.

## Requirements:

### To use Pysura to generate FastAPI microservices from Hasura metadata:

- Bring your own Hasura
- Python 3.6+

### To deploy Hasura with Pysura on Google and auto-deploy your microservices:

- gcloud CLI
- gcloud beta CLI
- A billing account with Google Cloud
- Docker (Make sure it's running in the background or your deploy will fail!)

### To bake in Phone Auth (Requires deployment on Google):

- Firebase CLI

# What is Pysura?

Pysura is a CLI tool that's designed to make building and deploying multi-tenant enterprise grade applications as easy
as a freshman year algorithms class. It's a highly opinionated way because it's the right way.

It's kind of like running npm init, if npm was for backends, it provides your backend, auth, and database for you in the
cloud in a way that is infinitely scalable and uses zero-trust, with a type-safe GraphQL backend and a
bring-your-own front-end with built-in support for Flutter.

## Do I need to deploy Hasura with Pysura to use it?

Nope! You can scaffold out all events, actions, and triggers with Pysura, but when you do... Auth won't work unless you
set it up yourself! Still useful for getting started with new projects though.

## Is this just a wrapper for the Hasura CLI?

Pysura does *not* use the Hasura CLI, and instead manages the metadata directly via retrieving it and overwriting it.

## Limitations:

Currently, this only supports a Google-based deployment/stack. Easily fixable. Just need a fellow AWS/Azure/Etc. wizard
who can translate the gcloud commands. I think the portability is pretty high since everything is done from the CLI. The
setup wizard is just curling everything.

## Neat! But it doesn't support my cloud provider, when will you be adding AWS/Azure/Etc. support?

I won't. You can. I built this because I needed it. If our stack changes providers, or potentially if someone was
willing to pay for it, I'd be willing to add support for other providers. But as of now, the best bet would be to open a
PR and add support for your provider of choice. I tried to design it to be pretty modular. The gcloud --format=json flag
is what changed the game when I found it.
