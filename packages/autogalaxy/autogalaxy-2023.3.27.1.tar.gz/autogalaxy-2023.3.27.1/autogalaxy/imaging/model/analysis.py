        """
        Analysis classes are used by PyAutoFit to fit a model to a dataset via a non-linear search.

        An Analysis class defines the `log_likelihood_function` which fits the model to the dataset and returns the
        log likelihood value defining how well the model fitted the data. The Analysis class handles many other tasks,
        such as visualization, outputting results to hard-disk and storing results in a format that can be loaded after
        the model-fit is complete using PyAutoFit's database tools.

        This Analysis class is used for model-fits which fit galaxies (or objects containing galaxies like a `Plane`)
        to an imaging dataset.

        This class stores the settings used to perform the model-fit for certain components of the model (e.g. a
        pixelization or inversion), the Cosmology used for the analysis and hyper datasets used for certain model
        classes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dataset
            The `Imaging` dataset that the model is fitted too.
        hyper_dataset_result
            The hyper-model image and hyper galaxies images of a previous result in a model-fitting pipeline, which are
            used by certain classes for adapting the analysis to the properties of the dataset.
        cosmology
            The Cosmology assumed for this analysis.
        settings_pixelization
            Settings controlling how a pixelization is fitted for example if a border is used when creating the
            pixelization.
        settings_inversion
            Settings controlling how an inversion is fitted for example which linear algebra formalism is used.

        """
        Given an instance of the model, where the model parameters are set via a non-linear search, fit the model
        instance to the imaging dataset.

        This function returns a log likelihood which is used by the non-linear search to guide the model-fit.

        For this analysis class, this function performs the following steps:

        1) If the analysis has a hyper dataset, associated the model galaxy images of this dataset to the galaxies in
           the model instance.

        2) Extract attributes which model aspects of the data reductions, like the scaling the background sky
           and background noise.

        3) Extracts all galaxies from the model instance and set up a `Plane`.

        4) Use the `Plane` and other attributes to create a `FitImaging` object, which performs steps such as creating
           model images of every galaxy in the plane, blurring them with the imaging dataset's PSF and computing residuals,
           a chi-squared statistic and the log likelihood.

        Certain models will fail to fit the dataset and raise an exception. For example if an `Inversion` is used, the
        linear algebra calculation may be invalid and raise an Exception. In such circumstances the model is discarded
        and its likelihood value is passed to the non-linear search in a way that it ignores it (for example, using a
        value of -1.0e99).

        Parameters
        ----------
        instance
            An instance of the model that is being fitted to the data by this analysis (whose parameters have been set
            via a non-linear search).

        Returns
        -------

            The log likelihood indicating how well this model instance fitted the imaging data.
