    """
    Returns a `Imaging` object from an aggregator's `SearchOutput` class, which we call an 'agg_obj' to describe
    that it acts as the aggregator object for one result in the `Aggregator`. This uses the aggregator's generator
    outputs such that the function can use the `Aggregator`'s map function to to create a `Imaging` generator.

     The `Imaging` is created following the same method as the PyAutoGalaxy `Search` classes, including using the
    `SettingsImaging` instance output by the Search to load inputs of the `Imaging` (e.g. psf_shape_2d).

    Parameters
    ----------
    fit
        A PyAutoFit aggregator's SearchOutput object containing the generators of the results of PyAutoGalaxy model-fits.

        """
        Returns a generator of `Imaging` objects from an input aggregator, which generates a list of the
        `Imaging` objects for every set of results loaded in the aggregator.

        This is performed by mapping the `imaging_from_agg_obj` with the aggregator, which sets up each
        imaging using only generators ensuring that manipulating the imaging of large sets of results is done in a
        memory efficient way.
