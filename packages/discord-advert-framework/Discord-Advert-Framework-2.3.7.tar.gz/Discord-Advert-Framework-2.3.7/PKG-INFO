DAF
=========================================================
    
The Discord advertisement framework is a  **shilling tool** that allows easy advertising on Discord.


Other information
----------------------
For more information see the project's webpage: https://daf.davidhozic.com.


Key features
----------------------
- Ability to run on **user** accounts (against discord's ToS) or **bot** accounts
- Periodic advertisement to **Direct (Private) Messages**, **Text channels** and **Voice channels**
- Advertising with either static data (text, embed, files, audio) or **dynamic data** (the data is obtained thru a function dynamically)
- Logging of sent messages to different outputs (also includes SQL)
- Ability to add additional application layers with help of asyncio
- Easy to setup

Caution!

While running this on user accounts is possible, it is **not recommended** since it is against Discord's ToS.
I am not responsible if your account get's disabled for using self-bots, however there are some protections to make
it harder for the API to detect a self-bot.
