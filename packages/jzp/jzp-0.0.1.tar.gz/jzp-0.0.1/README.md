A libary for dealing with the compression and decompression of Agilent JZP files.

I could not find documentation about this propietary format. Researching https://github.com/miek/agltzip I understood that the files consist on various possible versions of a header followed by LZSS compressed files.


## Installing

Install and update using `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install -U jzp
```
